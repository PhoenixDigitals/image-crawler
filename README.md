# Create Image Dataset for Machine Laerning

How to create a deep learning dataset using Bing Image Search

Deep learning algorithms, especially Convolutional Neural Networks, can be data hungry beasts.
And to make matters worse, manually annotating an image dataset can be a time consuming, tedious, 
and even expensive process.

So is there a way to leverage the power of **Bing Image Search** (differnet soruces are possible) to 
quickly gather training images and thereby cut down on the time it takes to build your dataset.
